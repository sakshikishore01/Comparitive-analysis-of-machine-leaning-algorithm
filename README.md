MNIST dataset (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology
database) is the subset of the NIST dataset which is a combination of two of
NIST’s databases: Special Database 1 and Special Database 3. Special Database
1 and Special Database 3 consist of digits written by high school students and
employees of the United States Census Bureau, respectively. MNIST contains a
total of 70,000 handwritten digit images (60,000 - training set and 10,000 - test set)
in a 28x28 pixel bounding box and anti-aliased. All these images have
corresponding Y values which apprises what the digit is.

The data is taken from the MNIST dataset and worked on by the following
algorithms as follows:-

● Logistic Regression
● Naive Bayes
● K-Nearest Neighbors
● Decision Tree
● Support Vector Machines
● Linear Regression
● Ridge Regression
● Neural Network Regression
● Lasso Regression
● Decision Tree Regression
● Random Forest


The comparison of these algorithms is based on the characteristic chart of each
algorithm on common grounds like dataset, the complexity of the algorithm,
accuracy of each algorithm, Comparison based on errors used to execute the
program, and runtime of the algorithm, under ideal conditions.
On the basis of the analysis of all the algorithms after comparing, the one which
will give us the maximum accuracy and minimum error will be the best one suited
for our handwritten digit recognition model.
